<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>CossiePlay means costume play.In this people wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character. Cosplayers often interact to create a subculture and a broader use of the term &quot;cosplay&quot; applies to any costumed role-playing in venues apart from the stage. Any entity that lends itself to dramatic interpretation may be taken up as a subject and it is not unusual to see genders switched. Favorite sources include manga and anime, comic books and cartoons, video games, and live-action films and television series.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Here people dress in various costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character. It depends on number of products sold.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>It is used to attract people for cossie play and buy the costumes.</p>
